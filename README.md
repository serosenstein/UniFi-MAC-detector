# UniFi-MAC-detector
A utility to run on a *nix system against the UniFi Controller to determine if a previously unknown MAC has been discovered on the network

Pre-reqs:

*Nix system  (needed for curl command because I'm too lazy to write the ProwlAPI call in Python or import a 3rd party library)

An API user created in UniFi Controller as a *LOCAL* Account
